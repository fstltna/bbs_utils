- **bbs_announce** (1.1) - This posts a text file to the desired groups. It posts as content, not a attachment! The settings are in the file at the top. Especially note that you need to copy (and edit unless you want to promote my BBS ðŸ˜„) the Announce.txt to /sbbs/exec.
- **perladd.pl** (1.15) - Scans the current folder for new files and adds them to your BBS's file area. Now has a option to enable you to add descriptions to your files at add-time.
- **updseen.pl** - Updates the perladd.pl /root/.seen file to fix issues - Not usually needed...
- **file_announce** (1.2) - This posts a list of files that you have added using perladd.pl to the message base of your choice. It posts as content, not a attachment! The settings are in the file at the top. Especially note that you need to copy (and edit unless you want to promote my BBS ðŸ˜„) the FilePost.txt & FilePostBottom.txt to /sbbs/exec. This version now handles long descriptions in the file list columns.
