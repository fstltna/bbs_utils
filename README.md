- **bbs_announce** - This posts a text file to the desired groups. It posts as content, not a attachment! The settings are in the file at the top. Especially note that you need to copy (and edit unless you want to promote my BBS ðŸ˜„) the Announce.txt to /sbbs/exec.
- **perladd.pl** - Scans the current folder for new files and submits them to your BBS.
- **updseen.pl** - Updates the perladd.pl /root/.seen file to fix issues - Not usually needed...
